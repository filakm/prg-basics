#Write a program that calculates how many times the given letter appears in any text. Then create a program and check how many times the letter 'e' appears in the text below. 
# In a separate module, define a function for making calculations. Sample result:

import module7
result = module7.counter()
print('You never get a second chance to make a first impression')
print(f'The number of letter "e": {result}')
