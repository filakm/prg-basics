#An influencer is a person who can influence other people's behaviour.
#  An influencer communicates with other people using social networking sites. 
# Write a program that checks whether a given person is a good influencer, 
# that is, whether the person has at least two of the following accounts: Facebook, Twitter or Instagram. Use logical type variables: facebook, twitter, instagram, 
# the value of which indicates whether the person has an account on the social networking site. Sample result:

facebook = True
twitter = False
instagram = True

if (facebook  and twitter) or (twitter and instagram ) or (instagram  and facebook):
    print('You are a good influencer!')

else:
    print('You are not a good influencer!')
